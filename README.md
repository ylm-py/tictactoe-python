# tictactoe-python
I just started learning programming with python and I almost learned the basics and currently I'm trying to practice by coding and I decided to create TicTacToe using python .
it's a 2 players mini-game . It looks so ugly but at least it's working ,and if someone knows how to prevent the grid from moving or someone wants to make it better feel free to contribute I will be more than happy !
